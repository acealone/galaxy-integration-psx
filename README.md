# galaxy-integration-psx
A Simple PlayStation 1 integration for GOG Galaxy 2.0
Download the zip and extract it into:
  %localappdata%\GOG.com\Galaxy\plugins\installed

Open user_config.py with a texteditor of your choice and change the paths of the rom folder and the epsxe.exe. 
Do the same for RetroArch. If you don't want to use RetroArch, change the variable "retroarch" to "False"
Note: This script uses the PCSX ReArmed Core for emulation. 
Make sure you keep the "r" in front of the path e.g. r"C:\Emulatoren\RetroArch\cores"

Multi-Disc Games should be converted into one *.pbp file using PSX2PSP. Search Google for tutorials.
